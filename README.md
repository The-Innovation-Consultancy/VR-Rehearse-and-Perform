* Unity android build support
* [3DTI](https://github.com/3DTune-In/3dti_AudioToolkit)
* [MRTK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/mrtk3-overview/)

All libraries and models should already be included. If not, the above links provide step-by-step guides to build the libraries. 

## Getting Started
Download the project, and make sure you get the **exact** unity version (or else some plugins might not work).

The 360 video file for the nature scene can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gMujD02cMoQts4t_hP2DyZym9ewYKQK6?usp=sharing). It needs to be pasted in the Assets \ Videos 
The Android library files required for the audio spatialisation to work can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gMujD02cMoQts4t_hP2DyZym9ewYKQK6?usp=sharing). 
The dynamic library files (*.so) need to be added under the appropriate folder in VR-Rehearse-and-Perform\Assets\3DTI\Binaural\Plugins\Android
